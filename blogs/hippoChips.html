        <p class="content">
            A well-known phrase in the advertising industry states that "When all else fails, use emotion. And when that
            seems a trifle out-of-sync proposition in the product category, rush to good ol' mother's love".
            <br>
            In India, "maa ka pyaar" (a mother's love) is a surefire winner. This is exactly what the snack brand
            "Hippo" did with its munchies variant. Initially, Parle Agro tried to tackle the global hunger issue with
            their product, but then shifted their focus to selling it based on the promise of love and care.
            <br>

            However, non of the strategy could stop Parle Agro from discontinuing Hippo chips. In this article, we'll
            examine the issues and failures that contributed to Hippo Chips' demise and explore the causes of its
            failure.
            <br>

            Lets discuss, what happened to Hippo chips and why Hippo chips were discontinued ?
            <br>

            Launched in 2009, Hippo Chips were a common snack found in lunchboxes and pantries all over the nation.
            Hippo Chips soared to fame and were well-known for their distinctive form and delightful crunch. But as time
            went on, the brand gradually disappeared, leaving people to wonder what went wrong.
            <img class="middleImages" alt="Image"
                src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/86a29f_a8aa0d4cfe014949bf93f15dae4e8140~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_569,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/86a29f_a8aa0d4cfe014949bf93f15dae4e8140~mv2.jpg"
                style="display: block;">
            Hippo's packaging was larger than the average snack packet, with a giant hippo logo on the front, bright
            colours intended to stand out from the crowd, and distinct flavours. The word HIPPO was spelt out in big,
            bold letters to match the personality of the creature on the front of the packet, a hefty fat hippo.
            <br><br>
            <h3><strong>Hippo Chips Flavours</strong></h3>
            <br>
            Hippo Snacks were launched in the following flavours:
            <ul>
                <li>Chinese Manchurian,</li>
                <li>Indian Chatpatta,</li>
                <li>Hot-n-Sweet Tomato,</li>
                <li>Italian Pizza,</li>
                <li>Yoghurt Mint Chutney,</li>
                <li>Thai Chilli Cream,</li>
                <li>Afghani Tikka Masala, and</li>
                <li>Greek Yogurt.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            The brand sought to be a guilt-free snack during hunger moments; hence the tagline "Hippo Fights Hunger" was
            chosen. Hippo was promoted with 'Hunger is the root of all evil. So, don't go hungry.'
            <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article"
                data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2118189722932279" data-ad-slot="9455538172"></ins>
            <br><br>
            1. The Plan-T Campaign
            Following its demand and supply issues, Hippo recognised the problem it was encountering and did not want
            the consumers to take the empty retail shelves as a manifestation of the brand's failure in a short period.

            They did not want to spend huge amounts of money outsourcing the distribution and supply tasks to withstand
            the demand-supply problem, so they directly communicated with their customers. This led to the beginning of
            the Plan-T campaign. To solve their difficulty, they urged their Twitter followers to submit a tweet with
            the hashtag @HelloMeHippoabout.

            The goal of this campaign was to include customers in every step of Hippo's supply chain across multiple
            locations, and it was successful since it drew a large number of enthusiastic participants.

            Using Twitter, Hippo recruited 400 new workers to help with sales and distribution at no expense. Its sales
            increased by 76% in the preliminary phase of its takeoff. Before the campaign launch, Hippo had 800
            followers on Twitter which soon increased by 300% to 4000 followers, which were equal to 50% of its sales
            and distribution network.

            Hippo gathered data from Twitter, analysed it, and forwarded it to regional distributors in the affected
            locations, who then refilled the shop shelves, ensuring that customers were satisfied within hours.

            Hippo was qualified to evaluate markets and observe potential markets for its business development with the
            help of this campaign. The good thing about Hippo was that it recognised its shortcomings and modified them
            into strengths by leveraging social media. Hippo used social media to connect with consumers and procure
            real-time outcomes to availability problems. The Twitter handle of Hippo was very active indeed! Before
            getting deactivated, it had more than 4000 tweets posted daily on everyday titbits.

            <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article"
                data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2118189722932279" data-ad-slot="9455538172"></ins>
            <br>
            2. Indian Food League
            In 2012, Hippo inaugurated an online campaign named IFL (Indian Food League) to attract cricket fans during
            the IPL (Indian Premier League) session.

            Indian Food League was modelled to fascinate all the cricket fans and apprehend the emotional rivalry
            amongst Indian cities during the IPL. The IFL rode on the already existing rivalry among T20 teams by
            pitting these regions' popular flavours and dishes against each other and getting people to comment in
            support of their favourite flavour on the IFL microsite.

            The dishes chosen were the speciality of that particular city, like Papdi Chat from Delhi, Kanda Poha from
            Pune, Dum Biryani from Hyderabad, Paratha from Punjab, Idli Sambhar from Chennai, Pav Bhaji from Mumbai, Dal
            Bati from Rajasthan, Masala Dosa from Banglore and Rosgolla from Kolkatta.

            The front of the pack would inform Hippo munchers to join the IFL. The back of the pack bore a QR Code that
            would direct Hippo munchers directly to the IFL microsite. They had to be as funny as possible to win that
            contest. Winners were declared daily and awarded with Hippo bean bags. IFL earned a stupendous
            acknowledgement, with Hippos sales going up during the IPL season.

            Now the question arises, if they were so great, then why were they discontinued? What happened to Hippo
            Chips?
            <br><br>
            Conclusion
            Everything appeared to be in order, but the product still died. In the late 2000s, the brand managed to
            overwhelm other brands for a period. Perhaps because the production costs were too high, consumers were too
            fixated on traditional chips, and because Hippo was not advertised or branded properly, the excitement
            fizzled out. It was discontinued, much to their loyalists' displeasure. Their Twitter account was disabled
            in 2014. Only old tweets and a petition online demanding the brand's relaunch exist today.
